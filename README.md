The 3d-shoe-configurator requires Three.js â€“ JavaScript 3D Library, https://threejs.org.

The idea for the 3d shoe configurator is to demonstrate various materials and textures 
that could be applied to a shoe. 

To start the application, click the index.html file within one of the three shoes folders:
hiking, athletic, high top

The application uses 3 3D, GLB files that are read in by three.js
